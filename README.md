# ROS2_learning_journey
The 367Mth starting material about ROS2. This time by someone who doesn't know ROS2 at all. What could go wrong?
#### Before getting started
This is not intended to be a full fledged ROS2 guide. I'm nowhere enough good to write one.

## Initial setup
Installing ROS2 in a Docker container in WSL2
